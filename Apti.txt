    A. The ski instructors at Top of the Peak Ski School work from December through March.
    B. Matthew prefers jobs that allow him to work outdoors.
    C. Lucinda makes an appointment with the beach resort restaurant manager to interview for the summer waitressing position that was advertised in the newspaper.
    D. Doug’s ice cream shop stays open until 11 p.m. during the summer months.

Answer: Option C

Explanation:

Although the ski instructors at Top of the Peak Ski School do work seasonally, choice a does not describe anyone applying for seasonal employment. In choice b, the statement that Matthew likes to work outdoors tells us nothing about seasonal employment or someone applying for it. And although choice d describes a business with seasonal hours, it does not describe a person applying for seasonal work. Choice c, on the other hand, very specifically depicts a person, Lucinda, who is applying for a job as a summer waitress at a beach resort, which is dependent upon a particular season of the year.

2. Here are some words translated from an artificial language.
mallonpiml means blue light
mallontifl means blueberry
arpantifl means raspberry
Which word could mean “lighthouse”?

    A. tiflmallon
    B. pimlarpan
    C. mallonarpan
    D. pimldoken

Answer: Option D

Explanation:

Mallon means blue; piml means light; tifl means berry; and arpan means “rasp” in raspberry. The word piml, which means light, is required for the word lighthouse. That rules out choices a and c. Arpan in choice b means “rasp,” so that rules out choice b. That leaves choice d the only possible answer.

4. Fact 1: Robert has four vehicles.
Fact 2: Two of the vehicles are red.
Fact 3: One of the vehicles is a minivan.
If the first three statements are facts, which of the following statements must also be a fact?
I. Robert has a red minivan.
II. Robert has three cars.
III. Robert’s favorite color is red.

    A. I only
    B. II only
    C. II and III only
    D. None of the statements is a known fact.

Answer: Option D

Explanation:

There is not enough information to support any of the statements. Robert is known to have a minvan, but it is not known which of his vehicles is red. Robert may have a pickup or sport utility vehicle, so the second statement cannot be supported. There is no way to know if Robert’s favorite color is red (statement III).

5. Fact 1: Eyeglass frames cost between $35 and $350.
Fact 2: Some eyeglass frames are made of titanium.
Fact 3: Some eyeglass frames are made of plastic.
If the first three statements are facts, which of the following statements must also be a fact?
I. Titanium eyeglass frames cost more than plastic frames.
II. Expensive eyeglass frames last longer than cheap frames.
III. Only a few eyeglass frames cost less than $35.

    A. II only
    B. I and II only
    C. II and III only
    D. None of the statements is a known fact.

Answer: Option D

Explanation:

There is no information in the facts to support statements I or II. Statement III is clearly wrong because, according to Fact 1, no frames cost less than $35.

7. Today’s workforce has a new set of social values. Ten years ago, a manager who was offered a promotion in a distant city would not have questioned the move. Today, a manager in that same situation might choose family happiness instead of career advancement.
This paragraph best supports the statement that

    A. most managers are not loyal to the corporations for which they work.
    B. businesses today do not understand their employees’ needs.
    C. employees’ social values have changed over the past ten years.
    D. career advancement is not important to today’s business managers.
    E. companies should require their employees to accept promotions.

Answer: Option C

Explanation:

A change in employee social values over the past ten years is implied in the whole paragraph, but particularly in the first sentence. Choice a is incorrect because the loyalty of the managers to their corporations is never discussed. There is no support for choice b. In choice d, perhaps career advancement is less important than it once was, but the paragraph does not indicate that advancement is unimportant to managers. Choice e is an opinion that is not supported.

8. In the past, consumers would rarely walk into an ice cream store and order low-fat ice cream. But that isn’t the case today. An increasing health consciousness combined with a much bigger selection of tasty low-fat foods in all categories has made low-fat ice cream a very profitable item for ice cream store owners.
This paragraph best supports the statement that

    A. low-fat ice cream produces more revenue than other low-fat foods.
    B. ice cream store owners would be better off carrying only low-fat ice cream.
    C. ice cream store owners no longer think that low-fat ice cream is an unpopular item.
    D. low-fat ice cream is more popular than other kinds of ice cream.
    E. consumers are fickle and it is impossible to please them.

Answer: Option C

Explanation:

This choice is supported as the best answer because the paragraph indicates that low-fat ice cream was once an unpopular item, but now, because consumers are more health conscious and because there is a wider array of tasty low-fat foods, low-fat ice cream is a profitable item for ice cream store owners. There is no indication that choices a, b, d, or e are true based on the information given.

14. Today’s high school students spend too much time thinking about trivial and distracting matters such as fashion. Additionally, they often dress inappropriately on school grounds. Rather than spending time writing another detailed dress policy, we should make school uniforms mandatory. If students were required to wear uniforms, it would increase a sense of community and harmony in our schools and it would instill a sense of discipline in our students. Another positive effect would be that teachers and administrators would no longer have to act as clothing police, freeing them up to focus on more important issues.
This paragraph best supports the statement that

    A. inappropriate clothing leads to failing grades.
    B. students who wear school uniforms get into better colleges.
    C. teachers and administrators spend at least 25% of their time enforcing the dress code.
    D. students are not interested in being part of a community.
    E. school uniforms should be compulsory for high school students.

Answer: Option E

Explanation:

The support for choice e is in the third sentence “. . . we should make school uniforms mandatory.” There is no evidence provided to support choices a, b, and d. And although we know that teachers and administrators are spending some of their time enforcing dress code, the paragraph does not quantify how much of their time is spent that way, so there is no support for choice c.
